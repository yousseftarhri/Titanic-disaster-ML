# Titanic-disaster-ML

## Overview
The goal of this project is to predict whether a passenger on the Titanic survived or not using machine learning techniques. The dataset includes features such as age, sex, class, fare, and more.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the Titanic dataset from Kaggle. It includes a training set (train.csv) and a test set (test.csv)"https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic/data". The training set is used to train the models, and the test set is used for making predictions.

## Usage
Download the Titanic dataset from Kaggle and place the train.csv and test.csv files in a folder named input inside the root directory of this repository.

Run the Jupyter notebook or Python script to preprocess the data, train the models, and make predictions

### Data Preprocessing

- Handle missing values
